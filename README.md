## Wine Exploration, Harvard Gov1005 Final project

New Zealandâ€™s wine industry is one of the youngest in the world, but the 'can-do' attitude of our pioneering winemakers and growers put in place a solid base for our innovative, world-class industry to flourish.

The New Zealand wine industry has grown over the past few years and is become famous around the world. I wanted to explore the growth of the booming industry and see how far we have come over. I also wanted to explore how far around the world we have reaching, just incase I find my self looking for some New Zealand wine whilst on holiday.

Here is a link to the New Zealand Wine webside. I used the data in their anual report data to shape my project https://www.nzwine.com/en/news-media/statistics-reports/ They also have some more interesting information and great graphics about the New Zealand wine indurstry that I would highly encourage you go check out.
